## Description:
I fetch this [Covid19 API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api/version-2) and display and style the data. I like this project because I learned quite a bit about front-end form validation and making a dynamic form. I made dropdown menus to select a day of the year, and the day dropdown menu needed to update according to changes to both the month and the year (so the user couldn't submit February 31, 2021, for example).
